# Building Information Model Assignment - 5D Planning on a Virtual Construction Site
__Due by: 14:00, Nov. 27th, 2017. Media transfer available from 11:00 [_location redaction_]__

Overall Grade Value: 15%

Projects are to be completed in small groups (no more than 4) of learners' choice. 

## Learning Goals
The goal of this project is to apply ‘soft’ skills of _logic_ and _planning_ on a job site using a virtual
model. While BIM is the 'medium', this project does not primarily test BIM authoring or data entry skills.
That is, producing a high level of detail or accuracy is not the most important aspect.

## Project Resources & Background
A BIM model of a pre-occupancy, commercial-industrial building is provided by the architect and design firm. It is
available via the course portal as a start point. 

The model has not yet received input from consultants, so the level of detail (LOD) is relatively low. For example, you will find a minimum
of mechanical equipment, and the main sloped runs for plumbing, but no elbow connections,
flow valves etc. Site grading is not considered but note that the model is already situated to take
advantage of the natural slope at the entrance grade (North East) and delivery grade (South
West)

__Substructure__ is site-cast concrete foundation walls, and caissons. 

__Superstructure__ is steel frame, and the envelope is primarily pre-cast concrete panels, with metal/composite panel highlights.

__The Roof__ has been simplified from its many layers (truss, decking, insulation, waterproofing etc.)
into a single element. 

Fabricators have yet to be involved so ___you are expected to do some research into each of these construction methods___. 

This includes making and stating assumptions about _batching_ and _delivery_. Consider _at least_, the amount or volume of materials as appopriate
(e.g. numbers of pallets of panels, trusses etc.), transportation methods, and distance.

This will also give you sources to cite for your schedule and cost decision making (material costs, time to complete tasks, order of operations etc.).
The designers want to start engaging with the contractors with the following expectations.
## Expectations

* Create a realistic schedule based on
  * the ‘hard’ mathematical methods, and data sources of the
course (equipment and labour productivity, safety, traffic control protocol, etc.)
  * what the model suggests in terms of construction methods _and the site configuration_
  * light research
* Link estimated schedule and cost data to appropriate model elements
  * Equipment you require (cranes, concrete mixer trucks, delivery flatbeds etc.) should be modeled as needed

__Hint:__ you can find ready-to-use equipment models in resources such as autodesk seek/forums,
revitcity, 3DCAD Browser etc.
* Produce an overall project simulation based on this linked data and your decisions guided by 'hard' course knowledge
* Explore, and analyze at least 1 simulation
  * Provide recommendations for improvement (efficiency, safety, etc.), and catch potential collisions/interference

## Deliverables
Final deliverables consist of: 
* one model file (.nwd format), containing all linked data
  * MS Project recommended for authoring schedule and cost data  
* one project report, documenting
  * group role-contributions, thought process for cost and schedule decisions, and comments about at least one simulation (e.g. shortest path constraints, potential improvements)
  * relevant formulas and data sources in an appendix, research sources in a reference section

Projects that go above and beyond will also model and simulate potential improvements to verify their feasibility. 
A _screenshot comparison_ or citing the simulation time, will be appreciated when referring to such improvements in the report.

## Technical Considerations: 
You will require access to _'Navisworks Manage'_. 
It is available in the [_location redaction_] computer labs, and the department’s
own computer lab. There is also a student version with full features available for use on personal computers for free download
from Autodesk.

Model files have the potential to be __large__, so it may be preferable to deliver via physical
storage media. Office hours for organized transfer will be scheduled on Nov. 27th prior to the submission deadline (starting at 11:00am). 

If no group member is available for transfer, please make other arrangements with the TA ahead
of time. 

An upload/share method is permitted, but it is each groups' responsibility to ensure
the TA is able to receive _and access_ the file well in advance of the project deadline.

## Assessment: 
Grading follows the project evaluation rubric contained in the course syllabus.
Generally, performing all expectations will earn a good mark. The best marks will go to projects that provide good
critique or thorough analysis of simulation(s).

## Support: 
The BIM module of the course, along with guest lectures, and a Navisworks
tutorial (Nov. 1), should provide enough to produce a high quality project (and may help with
other projects). 

Tutorial Instructions are posted to the course portal. A tentative date for troubleshooting is set for Nov. 24.

Autodesk also provide a robust knowledge network of articles, and content such as tutorials
that can assist with performing the various tasks of this project, and much more with Navisworks (animating
objects, camera flythroughs, etc.).
