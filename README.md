# Building_Information_Modeling_5D
This project is an educational module consisting of [one user guide document](https://github.com/ekonroyd/Building_Information_Modeling_5D/blob/main/Supplementary%20Material.md) to supplement in-person or webinar delivery of a tutorial; [one assignment](https://github.com/ekonroyd/Building_Information_Modeling_5D/blob/main/assignment.md) to test the expected learning outcomes; and [grade-feedback samples](https://github.com/ekonroyd/Building_Information_Modeling_5D/blob/main/Grade-Feedback.md).

## Why This Project is Important

A main outcome was developing '5D' simulation skills for new and retrofit construction projects using BIM SaaS. See below for an example simulation output.

### A Sample Simulation Output
Visualization of schedule data parameterized per component or assembly (green render represents work-in-progress).

## Methodology
I liased with client engineering, design, and sponsor customer success and education teams to produce tailored pilot projects for BIM technology. Often, subject matter focused on supporting new or existing energy or asset management programmes.

I participated in client discovery and elicitation and developed capacities in BIM through first-hand engagement. I delivered user guides, integration guides, training material, and internal documentation.

## What I Learned From This Project
I learned about the importance of internal documentation from this project. When problems occurred, internal documentation served as the first triage point. Realizing that a particular problem required more primary data, I could then reach out to client teams with a specific ask.
