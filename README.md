# Building_Information_Modeling_5D
This project is an educational module consisting of [one document to supplement in-person or webinar delivery of a tutorial](https://github.com/ekonroyd/Building_Information_Modeling_5D/blob/main/Supplementary%20Material.md); [one assignment](https://github.com/ekonroyd/Building_Information_Modeling_5D/blob/main/assignment.md) to test the expected learning outcomes; and [one grade-feedback file](https://github.com/ekonroyd/Building_Information_Modeling_5D/blob/main/Grade-Feedback.md).

A main outcome was developing '5D' simulation skills for new and retrofit construction projects. See below for an example simulation output.

## A Sample Simulation Output
Visualization of schedule data parameterized per component or assembly (green render represents work-in-progress).
