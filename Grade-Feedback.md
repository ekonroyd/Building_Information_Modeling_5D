# Grade-Feedback
Grading was performed according to a standard rubric. I provide example feedback from projects receiving different tiers of grades below.

## High (>88%)
__94+__

Good initial schedule and assumptions.  

Level of detail in the schedule (i.e. splitting column erection, etc.) and references is very good. Organization of the tasks is also nice.

Good simulation, and fly-through.  Great individual equipment animations.

Your simulation is very tight/efficient so I will assume there was some improvements/changes as you worked through the project.  It would have been nice if these were documented in the report.

## Medium (>75%)
__83__

In general: Leaving the topography in the simulation is good practice for providing context (rather than having a ‘floating’ building).  

The final deliverables called for a single report (PDF/word) – could have included schedules as appendices.  

Good initial schedule and assumptions. Level of detail is very good (roof access panel, dock levellers, etc.)  

Few minor issues: stairs are metal-fabricated (not concrete); exterior walls and roof should coordinate to finish together as opposed to start, (there can be some overlap, but roof completion relies on the parapet of exterior wall-build); mechanical schedule seems long for the simplicity of equipment at this stage.  

Good simulation.

Simulation improvements would have benefitted from some screen captures/annotation.

Good identification of additional desirable information – utility and traffic.

__80__

In general: Leaving the topography in the simulation is good practice for providing context (rather than a ‘floating’ building).

Good initial schedule/assumptions.  Flow/process chart is helpful.  Minor issue: L2 roof schedule deviates from report.

Good simulation.

Suggestion of greater level of detail is good, but altering viewpoints is something you could have performed

## Low (<70)
__64__

In general: the final deliverables called for a single report (PDF/word), whereas you provided several folders/documents.

Good initial schedule and assumptions.  

Level of detail is good, and well organized.  

Some misidentification – walls are pre-cast, not poured/structural, so this would affect validity of schedule.

Simulation is missing (no linked data).

Potential improvements are sensible, but without context from simulation they are not realistic in the sense that they affect a proposed schedule.
